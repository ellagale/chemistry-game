# chemistry-game





A VR chemistry laboratory simulation designed as part of my computing thesis at the University of Bristol. It is intended as a supplementary tool to the physical chemistry laboratory. In-game footage can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TznTpJ4gHKg).

Virtual laboratories are highly suited to VR given its highly interactive and multisensory nature that, to some extent, provides an authentic feeling of _actually_ being in the lab. However, the application of high-fidelity VR to a chemistry laboratory is hitherto largely unexplored. Hence, my thesis involved not only the production of the VR software but also a psychological testing component where I examined and evaluated the performance of several non-chemistry students who undertook a simple chemistry experiment (namely, the reflux procedure). The results and conclusions are described in my [thesis](../main/thesis_final.pdf).
